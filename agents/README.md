# Agents

This directory contains AI agents and autonomous components that interact with the LLM models.

## Purpose

The `agents/` directory is designed to house:
- Autonomous AI agents that can perform tasks independently
- Agent orchestration and coordination logic
- Agent-specific configurations and prompts
- Multi-agent communication protocols

## Structure

```
agents/
├── base/           # Base agent classes and interfaces
├── specialized/    # Task-specific agents (e.g., code_agent, chat_agent)
├── utils/         # Agent utilities and helper functions
└── configs/       # Agent-specific configuration files
```

## Getting Started

1. Create your agent by extending the base agent class
2. Implement the required methods for your specific use case
3. Configure the agent parameters in the configs directory
4. Test your agent with the provided testing utilities

## Examples

```python
# Example agent implementation
from agents.base import BaseAgent

class MyCustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
    
    def process_task(self, task):
        # Implement your agent logic here
        pass
```

## Contributing

When adding new agents:
- Follow the established naming conventions
- Include proper documentation and type hints
- Add unit tests for your agent
- Update this README with any new patterns or structures
